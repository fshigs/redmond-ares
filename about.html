<h1>Redmond ARES Mission</h1>
<p>The mission of the City of Redmond Amateur Radio Emergency Services (ARES) team is to provide the City of Redmond with communications support, as requested, for public events, drills and emergencies.</p>
<p>Redmond ARES members are official City of Redmond volunteers, and we are committed to serving, the City of Redmond.  For more information about the ARES served agency relationship—such as that between Redmond ARES and the City of Redmond—see the ARRL Emergency Communication Handbook, Chapter 4.</p>
<h1>What is ARES?</h1>
<p>The Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) is a group of licensed amateurs who have voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment for communications duty in the public service when disaster strikes.</p>
<p>ARRL, the national organization for amateur radio, has sponsored the ARES program since 1935.  ARES is part of the ARRL field organization. See Washington State ARES for more information.</p>
<p>In addition to serving local communities, ARES has formal agreements with organizations such as the American Red Cross, National Weather Service, Department of Homeland Security, Citizen Corps, and REACT International, Inc.</p>
