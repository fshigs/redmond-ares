<h3>PRESS RELEASE: Field Day tests Redmond ARES emergency skills</h3>
<p>Saturday, June 14, 2014</p>

<h4>Theme for this year's exercise: "Ham Radio Goes Digital"​</h4>
<p>Amateur radio has come a long way from dots and dashes—and so have the members of the city's emergency communications volunteer group, Redmond Amateur Radio Emergency Services (ARES). During their annual field day exercise on Saturday June 29 at Fire Station 17, Redmond ARES volunteers will test their ability to set up and operate long-distance radio equipment in situations where electrical power is limited or unavailable. The event is open to the public. A special focus of this year's exercise will be ongoing presentations on how to use high-frequency radio equipment to send non-traditional content such as text or graphics over long distances. The group will also be testing some of the latest digital ham radio equipment for local communications.</p>
